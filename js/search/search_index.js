\n\n@stomp/ng2-stompjs\nAngular 2/4/5 \nAngular 6 \nAn Angular (Angular2, Angular4, Angular5, Angular6 ...) style wrapper for @stomp/stompjs.\nVersion Compatibility\nWhile we tried really hard to support multiple Angular versions with same release -\nactually succeeded for Anguar 2/4/5, it is not possible for Angular 6. This library\nmakes quite extensive use of rxjs which has undergone breaking changes in Angular 6.\nGoing forward following numbering scheme will be followed:\n\n6.x.x - managed in master branch, will only support Angular 6 - use dependency like \"^6.0.0\" \n4.x.x - managed in angular4 branch, will support Angular 2/4/5 - use dependency like \"^4.0.0\"\n\nFor the time being both versions will be maintained. From October 2018, only critical\nupdates will be applied to 4.x.x releases.\nAs of now both versions offer exactly same APIs.\nSpecial Request\nRecently documentation has been switched to\nCompodoc from TypeDoc.\nPlease raise an issue if you find broken links or inconsistency in documentation.\nDocumentation\nPlease head to https://stomp-js.github.io/ng2-stompjs/\nChangelog at https://stomp-js.github.io/ng2-stompjs/changelog.html\nCompatibility\nTested with Angular CLI generated Angular2 (2.4.0), Angular4 (4.0.0), \nAngular (5.0.0). \nIt has been reported to work with ionic projects as well.\nInstallation\nTo install this library, run:\n$ npm install @stomp/ng2-stompjs --saveor, if using yarn:\n$ yarn add @stomp/ng2-stompjsThis will additionally install @stomp/stompjs \nfrom https://github.com/stomp-js/stomp-websocket\nUsage\n\nSee API documentation at \nhttps://stomp-js.github.io/ng2-stompjs/injectables/StompService.html,\nhttps://stomp-js.github.io/ng2-stompjs/injectables/StompRService.html\nand https://stomp-js.github.io/ng2-stompjs/index.html\nGeneral Demos (using Angular CLI)\nhttps://github.com/stomp-js/ng6-stompjs-demo\nhttps://github.com/stomp-js/ng5-stompjs-demo\nhttps://github.com/stomp-js/ng4-stompjs-demo\nhttps://github.com/stomp-js/ng2-stompjs-demo \n\n\nhttps://github.com/stomp-js/ng2-stompjs-demo also demonstrates fetching\nStomp configuration using a http call (APP_INITIALIZER)\nSee SockJS Support.\nhttps://github.com/stomp-js/ng4-stompjs-demo/tree/sockjs for a sample\nusing SockJS\n\nSockJS Users\nYou must read https://stomp-js.github.io/ng2-stompjs/additional-documentation/sock-js.html  \nPrerequisites\n\nYou will need to have a Stomp broker running.\nThe sample code on this page assumes you have\nRabbitMQ running with default settings and Web STOMP plugin activated.\n(see: https://www.rabbitmq.com/web-stomp.html.)\n\nAll the Hard Work\n\nThe main service is StompService, which will need to be provided\nThe STOMP Broker connection details will need to be provided viaclass StompConfig. See the samples for several ways to configure it\nSee https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/dependency-injection.html for\nbackground reading\nSample configuration:\n\n    const stompConfig: StompConfig = {\n      // Which server?\n      url: 'ws://127.0.0.1:15674/ws',\n\n      // Headers\n      // Typical keys: login, passcode, host\n      headers: {\n        login: 'guest',\n        passcode: 'guest'\n      },\n\n      // How often to heartbeat?\n      // Interval in milliseconds, set to 0 to disable\n      heartbeat_in: 0, // Typical value 0 - disabled\n      heartbeat_out: 20000, // Typical value 20000 - every 20 seconds\n\n      // Wait in milliseconds before attempting auto reconnect\n      // Set to 0 to disable\n      // Typical value 5000 (5 seconds)\n      reconnect_delay: 5000,\n\n      // Will log diagnostics on console\n      debug: true\n    };\nSee https://github.com/stomp-js/ng4-stompjs-demo/blob/master/src/app/app.module.ts \nfor a sample code file with configuration passed from a local\nhash. Feel free to copy and modify this file\nSee https://github.com/stomp-js/ng2-stompjs-demo/blob/master/src/app/app.module.ts\nfor a sample code file with configuration fetched from a http\nresource\nAssuming the config specified as a const, code sample to \nprovide StompService and StompConfig will look like:\n\n  providers: [\n    StompService,\n    {\n      provide: StompConfig,\n      useValue: stompConfig\n    }\n  ]\nSee https://github.com/stomp-js/ng4-stompjs-demo/blob/master/src/app/app.module.ts\nfor a sample file\n\nReap the Benefits\nInject StompService\nIn your constructor (typically of a component or a service), inject\n  StompService as a dependency:\nconstructor(private _stompService: StompService) { }Subscribe to a queue\nThe queue name structure and semantics vary\nbased on your specific STOMP Broker, \nsee: https://www.rabbitmq.com/stomp.html\nfor RabbitMQ specific details.\nCall subscribe(queueName: string, headers: StompHeaders = {}) \nwith name of the queue which returns an Observable (details at:\nhttps://stomp-js.github.io/ng2-stompjs/injectables/StompRService.html#subscribe). Any\nof Observable specific operators (map, filter, subscribe, etc.) can be\napplied on it. This can also be set into a template with async pipe.\nExample:\n    let stomp_subscription = this._stompService.subscribe('/topic/ng-demo-sub');\n\n    stomp_subscription.map((message: Message) => {\n      return message.body;\n    }).subscribe((msg_body: string) => {\n      console.log(`Received: ${msg_body}`);\n    });\nThe Message class comes from @stomp/stompjs. So, you will need the\nfollowing import in the classes where you consume messages:\nimport {Message} from '@stomp/stompjs';Unsubscribe from a queue\nYou will need to unsubscribe from stomp_subscription (which is an Observer),\nit will then internally unsubscribe from the underlying STOMP queue\nsubscription.\nPublishing messages\nCall publish(queueName: string, message: string, headers: StompHeaders = {}) \n(details at: https://stomp-js.github.io/ng2-stompjs/injectables/StompRService.html#publish).\nExample:\nthis._stompService.publish('/topic/ng-demo-sub', 'My important message');Please note that message is actually string. So, if you need to send JSON\nyou will need to convert it into string (typically using \nJSON.stringify())\nWatching for Stomp connection status\n\nstompService.state is a BehaviorSubject which maintains and switches\nits value as per the underlying Stomp Connection status.\nThe value is from an enum with these possible values: \nCLOSED\nTRYING\nCONNECTED\nDISCONNECTING\n\n\nThe following code will subscribe to stompService.state and convert\nthe enum value (which is a number) to the corresponding string value:\n\n    this._stompService.state\n      .map((state: number) => StompState[state])\n      .subscribe((status: string) => {\n      console.log(`Stomp connection status: ${status}`);\n    });If you are interested in watching only when connection is established, you can\nsubscribe to this._stompService.connectObservable.\nDelayed initialization\nIt is usually possible to use Angular dependency injection techniques and\nAPP_INITIALIZER to delay the initialization till the configuration is ready\n(may be fetched using an API call.) See a sample at:\nhttps://github.com/stomp-js/ng2-stompjs-demo\nThe initialization process can be manually controlled with the additional \nclass StompRService which is injected \ninstead of StompService. This has a few additional\nmethods to assign a configuration and manually initiate the connection to the STOMP Broker.\n// Do not provide StompService or StompConfig, only provide StompRService\n\n  providers: [\n    StompRService\n  ]\nclass YourClass {}\n    constructor(private _stompService: StompRService) { }\n\n    public initStomp() {\n      StompConfig config;\n\n      cofig = this.fetchConfigFromSomeWhere();\n\n      this._stompService.config = config;\n      this._stompService.initAndConnect();\n    }\n}The methods subscribe and publish can be called even before call to initAndConnect.\nHowever these will be queued till the actual connection is successful.\nFor the curious - initAndConnect may be called more than once with a potentially\nupdated configuration.\nContributors\n\nSam Finnigan\nJimi (Dimitris) Charalampidis\nDeepak Kumar\nAstha Deep\nMichel Promonet\nEveryone involved at https://github.com/stomp-js/stomp-websocket\n\nLicense\nMIT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nCopyright (c) 2017 Deepak Kumar\nMIT License\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.

It will be streamlined in a\nfuture release.\nPlease read notes on SockJS support of the underlying library at\nhttps://stomp-js.github.io/stomp-websocket/codo/extra/docs-src/sockjs.md.html\n\nUsage\nInstall SockJS Client\n$ npm install sockjs-client --saveImport SockJS class\nimport * as SockJS from 'sockjs-client';Implement a socketProvider\nCreate a function that returns an object similar to WebSocket (typically SockJS instance).\nexport function socketProvider() {\n  return new SockJS('http://127.0.0.1:15674/stomp');\n}StompConfig\nPass the function as url in StompConfig.\n It will work even\nthough name of the parameter is url, don't worry :)\nExample:\nconst stompConfig: StompConfig = {\n  // Which server?\n  url: socketProvider,\n\n  // Headers\n  // Typical keys: login, passcode, host\n  headers: {\n    login: 'guest',\n    passcode: 'guest'\n  },\n\n  // How frequent is the heartbeat?\n  // Interval in milliseconds, set to 0 to disable\n  heartbeat_in: 0, // Typical value 0 - disabled\n  heartbeat_out: 20000, // Typical value 20000 - every 20 seconds\n\n  // Wait in milliseconds before attempting auto reconnect\n  // Set to 0 to disable\n  // Typical value 5000 (5 seconds)\n  reconnect_delay: 5000,\n\n  // Will log diagnostics on console\n  debug: true\n};Limitations\nCopied from https://stomp-js.github.io/stomp-websocket/codo/extra/docs-src/sockjs.md.html\n\nSockJS is an emulation of WebSockets. This is not a complete implementation.\nHeart beating is not supported.\nSockJS internally uses one of many possible means to communicate. In some of those, auto reconnect may occasionally fail.\n\nWhen Hacking Code of this Library\n\nWhen developing on this library code to use SockJS, please adjust the unit tests to use\nSockJS.\nUnit testes may occasionally fail in SockJS. It is because of limitations\nof SockJS around allowing only one SockJS connection at a time. Usually \nthis should not affect your usage of the library.\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/contributing.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/contributing.html","title":"additional-page - Contributing","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContributing\nDevelopment\nAfter checking out from GitHub, install the dependencies:\n$ npm installor, if using yarn:\n$ yarnTo generate documentation:\n$ npm run docTo lint all *.ts files:\n$ npm run lint\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
