This version also demonstrates fetching\nStomp configuration using a http call (APP_INITIALIZER)\nSee SockJS Support.\nhttps://github.com/stomp-js/ng4-stompjs-demo/tree/sockjs for a sample\nusing SockJS\n\nSockJS Users\nYou must read https://stomp-js.github.io/ng2-stompjs/additional-documentation/sock-js.html  \nPrerequisites\n\nYou will need to have a Stomp broker running.\nThe sample code on this page assumes you have\nRabbitMQ running with default settings and Web STOMP plugin activated.\n(see: https://www.rabbitmq.com/web-stomp.html.)\n\nAll the Hard Work\n\nThe main service is StompService, which will need to be provided\nThe STOMP Broker connection details will need to be provided viaclass StompConfig. See the samples for several ways to configure it\nSee https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/dependency-injection.html for\nbackground reading\nSample configuration:\n\n    const stompConfig: StompConfig = {\n      // Which server?\n      url: 'ws://127.0.0.1:15674/ws',\n\n      // Headers\n      // Typical keys: login, passcode, host\n      headers: {\n        login: 'guest',\n        passcode: 'guest'\n      },\n\n      // How often to heartbeat?\n      // Interval in milliseconds, set to 0 to disable\n      heartbeat_in: 0, // Typical value 0 - disabled\n      heartbeat_out: 20000, // Typical value 20000 - every 20 seconds\n\n      // Wait in milliseconds before attempting auto reconnect\n      // Set to 0 to disable\n      // Typical value 5000 (5 seconds)\n      reconnect_delay: 5000,\n\n      // Will log diagnostics on console\n      debug: true\n    };\nSee https://github.com/stomp-js/ng4-stompjs-demo/blob/master/src/app/app.module.ts \nfor a sample code file with configuration passed from a local\nhash. Feel free to copy and modify this file\nSee https://github.com/stomp-js/ng2-stompjs-demo/blob/master/src/app/app.module.ts\nfor a sample code file with configuration fetched from a http\nresource\nAssuming the config specified as a const, code sample to \nprovide StompService and StompConfig will look like:\n\n  providers: [\n    StompService,\n    {\n      provide: StompConfig,\n      useValue: stompConfig\n    }\n  ]\nSee https://github.com/stomp-js/ng4-stompjs-demo/blob/master/src/app/app.module.ts\nfor a sample file\n\nReap the Benefits\nInject StompService\nIn your constructor (typically of a component or a service), inject\n  StompService as a dependency:\nconstructor(private _stompService: StompService) { }Subscribe to a queue\nThe queue name structure and semantics vary\nbased on your specific STOMP Broker, \nsee: https://www.rabbitmq.com/stomp.html\nfor RabbitMQ specific details.\nCall subscribe(queueName: string, headers: StompHeaders = {}) \nwith name of the queue which returns an Observable (details at:\nhttps://stomp-js.github.io/ng2-stompjs/injectables/StompRService.html#subscribe). Any\nof Observable specific operators (map, filter, subscribe, etc.) can be\napplied on it. This can also be set into a template with async pipe.\nExample:\n    let stomp_subscription = this._stompService.subscribe('/topic/ng-demo-sub');\n\n    stomp_subscription.map((message: Message) => {\n      return message.body;\n    }).subscribe((msg_body: string) => {\n      console.log(`Received: ${msg_body}`);\n    });The Message class comes from @stomp/stompjs. So, you will need the\nfollowing import in the classes where you consume messages:\nimport {Message} from '@stomp/stompjs';Unsubscribe from a queue\nYou will need to unsubscribe from stomp_subscription (which is an Observer),\nit will then internally unsubscribe from the underlying STOMP queue\nsubscription.\nPublishing messages\nCall publish(queueName: string, message: string, headers: StompHeaders = {}) \n(details at: https://stomp-js.github.io/ng2-stompjs/injectables/StompRService.html#publish).\nExample:\nthis._stompService.publish('/topic/ng-demo-sub', 'My important message');Please note that message is actually string. So, if you need to send JSON\nyou will need to convert it into string (typically using \nJSON.stringify())\nWatching for Stomp connection status\n\nstompService.state is a BehaviorSubject which maintains and switches\nits value as per the underlying Stomp Connection status.\nThe value is from an enum with these possible values: \nCLOSED\nTRYING\nCONNECTED\nDISCONNECTING\n\n\nThe following code will subscribe to stompService.state and convert\nthe enum value (which is a number) to the corresponding string value:\n\n    this._stompService.state\n      .map((state: number) => StompState[state])\n      .subscribe((status: string) => {\n      console.log(`Stomp connection status: ${status}`);\n    });If you are interested in watching only when connection is established, you can\nsubscribe to this._stompService.connectObservable.\nDelayed initialization\nIt is usually possible to use Angular dependency injection techniques and\nAPP_INITIALIZER to delay the initialization till the configuration is ready\n(may be fetched using an API call.) See a sample at:\nhttps://github.com/stomp-js/ng2-stompjs-demo\nThe initialization process can be manually controlled with the additional \nclass StompRService which is injected \ninstead of StompService. This has a few additional\nmethods to assign a configuration and manually initiate the connection to the STOMP Broker.\n// Do not provide StompService or StompConfig, only provide StompRService\n\n  providers: [\n    StompRService\n  ]class YourClass {}\n    constructor(private _stompService: StompRService) { }\n\n    public initStomp() {\n      StompConfig config;\n\n      cofig = this.fetchConfigFromSomeWhere();\n\n      this._stompService.config = config;\n      this._stompService.initAndConnect();\n    }\n}The methods subscribe and publish can be called even before call to initAndConnect.\nHowever these will be queued till the actual connection is successful.\nFor the curious - initAndConnect may be called more than once with a potentially\nupdated configuration.\nContributors\n\nSam Finnigan\nJimi (Dimitris) Charalampidis\nDeepak Kumar\nAstha Deep\nMichel Promonet\nEveryone involved at https://github.com/stomp-js/stomp-websocket\n\nLicense\nMIT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"overview.html":{"url":"overview.html","title":"overview - overview","body":"\n                   \n\n\nOverview\n\n    \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        3 injectables\n                    \n                \n            \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"changelog.html":{"url":"changelog.html","title":"getting-started - changelog","body":"\n                   \n\nChangelog\n0.6.4\n\nUpdates in test cases.\nDocumentation update.\nUpdated dependency of @stomp/stompjs to >= 4.0.2\nwaitForReceipt now passes the frame to the callback.\n\n0.6.3\n\nSwitched to Compodoc from TypeDoc.\nChanged StompHeaders types to allow any type (instead of string) as value.\nDocumentation changes.\n\n0.6.2\n\nAdded ability to get server headers from CONNECTED Frame \nhttps://stomp-js.github.io/ng2-stompjs/injectables/StompRService.html#serverHeadersObservable\nEnabled Travis\n\n0.6.1\n\nUpdated dependencies\n\n0.6.0\n\nJump in version number to indicate compiled JS release\nImproved Angular 5 support\n\n0.4.3\n\nAbility to delay initialization\nAngular 5 compatibility\n\n0.4.2\n\nInitial SockJS Support.\nSample at https://github.com/stomp-js/ng4-stompjs-demo/tree/sockjs\n\n0.4.0\n\nUpdated to make it compliant to possible use of APP_INITIALIZER.

It will be streamlined in a\nfuture release.\nPlease read notes on SockJS support of the underlying library at\nhttps://stomp-js.github.io/stomp-websocket/codo/extra/docs-src/sockjs.md.html\n\nUsage\nInstall SockJS Client\n$ npm install sockjs-client --saveImport SockJS class\nimport * as SockJS from 'sockjs-client';Implement a socketProvider\nCreate a function that returns an object similar to WebSocket (typically SockJS instance).\nexport function socketProvider() {\n  return new SockJS('http://127.0.0.1:15674/stomp');\n}StompConfig\nPass the function as url in StompConfig.\n It will work even\nthough name of the parameter is url, don't worry :)\nExample:\nconst stompConfig: StompConfig = {\n  // Which server?\n  url: socketProvider,\n\n  // Headers\n  // Typical keys: login, passcode, host\n  headers: {\n    login: 'guest',\n    passcode: 'guest'\n  },\n\n  // How frequent is the heartbeat?\n  // Interval in milliseconds, set to 0 to disable\n  heartbeat_in: 0, // Typical value 0 - disabled\n  heartbeat_out: 20000, // Typical value 20000 - every 20 seconds\n\n  // Wait in milliseconds before attempting auto reconnect\n  // Set to 0 to disable\n  // Typical value 5000 (5 seconds)\n  reconnect_delay: 5000,\n\n  // Will log diagnostics on console\n  debug: true\n};Limitations\nCopied from https://stomp-js.github.io/stomp-websocket/codo/extra/docs-src/sockjs.md.html\n\nSockJS is an emulation of WebSockets. This is not a complete implementation.\nHeart beating is not supported.\nSockJS internally uses one of many possible means to communicate. In some of those, auto reconnect may occasionally fail.\n\nWhen Hacking Code of this Library\n\nWhen developing on this library code to use SockJS, please adjust the unit tests to use\nSockJS.\nUnit testes may occasionally fail in SockJS. It is because of limitations\nof SockJS around allowing only one SockJS connection at a time.
